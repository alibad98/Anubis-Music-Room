## Django & React - Function Based Components

This GitHub repository is a modification of the "Django & React - Full Stack Web App Tutorial" series by Tech With Tim. Inspired by the original series, this project focuses on creating a full-stack web application using Django and React, but with a significant twist: it employs function-based components in JSX instead of class-based components, utilizing React v6.

## Features

- **Function-based Components**: All React components are written using the function-based approach, demonstrating the latest best practices in React development.
   
- **Django Integration**: The project integrates Django, a high-level Python web framework, for backend development, ensuring robustness, security, and scalability.
   
- **Full Stack Implementation**: With Django powering the backend and React handling the frontend, this project offers a comprehensive demonstration of building a full-stack web application from scratch.

- **Modified Tutorial**: While inspired by the Tech With Tim tutorial series, this repository presents modifications to accommodate the function-based component approach and React v6, providing developers with an alternative perspective on building similar applications.

- **Additional Dependencies**: The project utilizes `@babel` for transpiling JSX, `@mui` for Material-UI components, and `react-router-dom` for routing within the React application.

## Setup

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Change directory to `music_controller`.
3. Run the command `python manage.py runserver` to start the Django server.
4. Navigate to `music_controller/frontend`.
5. Run the command `npm run dev` to start the React development server.

## Dependencies

- `@babel`: Transpiler for JSX.
- `@mui`: Material-UI components for React.
- `react-router-dom`: Routing library for React applications.

## Usage

Developers can use this repository as a valuable educational resource to learn about modern React development practices, Django integration, and the process of building full-stack web applications. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to explore new techniques or a newcomer eager to learn, this project offers a valuable learning experience in modern web development.
