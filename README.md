This GitHub repository is a modification of the "Django &amp; React - Full Stack Web App Tutorial" series by Tech With Tim. Inspired by the original series, this project focuses on creating a full-stack web application using Django and React, but with a significant twist: it employs function-based components in JSX instead of class-based components.
